This section expands on the detection rules by leveraging automated YARA scanning

Add a YARA signature for the sliver c2 payload

1. In limaCharlie -> automation -> YARA rules -> name: sliver -> save rule as sliver-process
    a. ruleblock :(https://gist.githubusercontent.com/ecapuano/f40d5a99d19500538984bd88996cfe68/raw/12587427383def9586580647de13b4a89b9d4130/sliver_broad.yara)

2. create new D&R rule
    detect(YARA detections not involving a process object):event: YARA_DETECTION
            op: and
            rules:
              - not: true
                op: exists
                path: event/PROCESS/*
              - op: exists
                path: event/RULE_NAME
    respond- action: report
            name: YARA Detection {{ .event.RULE_NAME }}
          - action: add tag
            tag: yara_detection
            ttl: 80000
    a. Save as YARA DETECTION

3. create a new rule (YARA detections WITH a process object
detect: event: YARA_DETECTION
        op: and
        rules:
          - op: exists
            path: event/RULE_NAME
          - op: exists
            path: event/PROCESS/*

respond - action: report
          name: YARA Detection in Memory {{ .event.RULE_NAME }}
        - action: add tag
          tag: yara_detection_memory
          ttl: 80000
-name: YARA DETECTION IN MEMORY

Test the YARA signature

1. go to sensors -> console -> yara_scan hive://yara/sliver -f C:\Users\User\Downloads\[payload_name].exe to kick off a manual YARA scan of out sliver payload

Automatic YARA scan on downloadee EXEs

Automation -> D&R rules
rulename: YARA Scan Downloaded EXE
detect (looking fo rNEW .exe files to appear in the user's downloads directory):
event: NEW_DOCUMENT
op: and
rules:
  - op: starts with
    path: event/FILE_PATH
    value: C:\Users\
  - op: contains
    path: event/FILE_PATH
    value: \Downloads\
  - op: ends with
    path: event/FILE_PATH
    value: .exe

respond (generates an alert for the EXE creation and starts a YARA scan using the sliver signature)
- action: report
  name: EXE dropped in Downloads directory
- action: task
  command: >-
    yara_scan hive://yara/sliver -f "{{ .event.FILE_PATH
    }}"
  investigation: Yara Scan Exe
  suppression:
    is_global: false
    keys:
      - '{{ .event.FILE_PATH }}'
      - Yara Scan Exe
    max_count: 1
    period: 1m


Auto Scan processes launched from the downloads directory:
detect (matching any processes that is launched from a user's downloads directory)
event: NEW_PROCESS
op: and
rules:
  - op: starts with
    path: event/FILE_PATH
    value: C:\Users\
  - op: contains
    path: event/FILE_PATH
    value: \Downloads\

respond (scanning the actual process, not the file path)
- action: report
  name: Execution from Downloads directory
- action: task
  command: yara_scan hive://yara/sliver-process --pid "{{ .event.PROCESS_ID }}"
  investigation: Yara Scan Process
  suppression:
    is_global: false
    keys:
      - '{{ .event.PROCESS_ID }}'
      - Yara Scan Process
    max_count: 1
    period: 1m

Time to trigger the rules!

1. move the sliver payload to downloads with this command: 'Move-Item -Path C:\Users\User\Downloads\[payload_name].exe -Destination C:\Users\User\Documents\[payload_name].exe" on powershell

2. now we are putting it back to generat ethe new_document event for an exe being put into the downloads folder : 'Move-Item -Path C:\Users\User\Documents\[payload_name].exe -Destination C:\Users\User\Downloads\[payload_name].exe'

3. In the detections tab I cna see the initial alert for an exe dropped in downloads followed by a YARA detection once the scan found sliver in the exe

Test the New_process rule:

1. launch an admin powershell prompt
    a. kill any existing instances of our sliver c2 : 'Get-Process [payload_name] | Stop-Process'

2. time to execute the sliver payload to generate the new_process event: 'C:\Users\User\Downloads\[payload_name].exe'

3. In the detections tab I can see an initial aler for Excecution from downloads followed by a YARA detection in memory once the scan found sliver in the exe

thanks for reading!!
