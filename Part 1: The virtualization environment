erThis section will have me set up 2 VMs in WMware workstation 
The first VM will be a free Windows Enterprise VM and the second an Ubuntu based VM.
All the links to resources used will be at the bottom of this page

I want this lab to serve as an introduction to homelabs to me as well as give me more practice with and familiarity of VM's and virtualization environments in general.
