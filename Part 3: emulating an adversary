This part will show me emulating an adversary and making rules in LimaCharlie to detect said adversary

Getting Adversarial:

1. First off, get back intot he Sliver C2 session from the previous part. The goal is to start doing some shady activities that we would want to be able to detect.

2. The next few commands need to be ran in the sliver session on the victim host
  a. starting out, I need to see what privileges I have: 'getprivs', really the main one I am looking for is 'SeDebugPrivilege'
  b. now its time to do the classic move for stealing credentials; dump the lsass.exe process from memory: 'procdump -n lsass.exe -s lsass.dmp'
    -this dumps the remote process from memory and saves it locally on the C2 server

Now Time to Detect It:

1. Switch over to LimaCharlie so that we can find the relevant telemetry
  a. because lsass.exe is a known sensitive process, any good EDR will generate events for this.
  b. Filter for 'SENSITIVE_PROCESS_ACCESS' events 
  c. now that I have selected an event, its time to make a D&R rule to alert us anytime this activity happens
  d. The detect section of the rule (I am specifying that the detection should only look at 'SENSITIVE_PROCESS_ACCESS' events where the victim or target process ends with lsass.exe):
        -event: SENSITIVE_PROCESS_ACCESS
          op: ends with
          path: event/*/TARGET/FILE_PATH
          value: lsass.exe
  e. here is the respond section (telling LimaCharlie to make a report anytime this detection occurs):
        - action: report
          name: LSASS access
  f. I tested the rule on the bottom of the page ('test event' button) to be certain that it actually works 
  g. Save the rule with the nam,e 'lsass accessed'

2. rerun the procdump command and make sure that the detection rule works!
