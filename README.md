# HomeLab-1
This repository is for documenting my first homelab to improve my chances of landing an entry-level SOC analyst job

This Homelab will consist of six different parts:
Part1: Setting up a small virtualization environment (2 small VMs)
Part2: Making and observing some noise
Part3: Emulating an adversary to craft detections
Part4: Blcoking an Attack
Part5: Tuning false positives
Part6: Trigger YARA scans with a detection rule

I will try and document nearly everything that I do and why I did it as well as link any resoruces I used along the way. 
Thanks for reading and hope you enjoy!
